## Limitations

The list of latest features delivered in the React Store Applications are described for Emerald:

https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/storeseparation/refs/react_emerald_flows.html

and for Sapphire:

https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/storeseparation/refs/react_sapphire_flows.html

Additional pages and features will be added to the React Store Application for Emerald and Sapphire in future releases of the HCL Commerce Store SDK.

There are specific limitations in the React store applications that developers and customers need to be aware of:

1. For Sapphire, support for specific contract terms and conditions are limited product restriction and price terms and conditions.
   Others terms and conditions such as Fulfillment Centers, Shipping Charges, Right to Buy limits, or mixed contracts that incur
   Multiple Shipment/Payment are not yet supported and may not appear or cause checkout to not complete.

1. A customer shopping session on the store can be shared across multiple tabs on the same browser and is maintained in local storage to support browsing
   and shopping across multiple tabs even though each tab is running as a separate applications. If modifications to the user, addresses or cart are made
   in one tab, any other tab will maintain the same user session but may require the customer to reload the page in order for the tab to see the updated modifications.
   Further, some specific states that are maintained in the React application during checkout flow such as the selection of recurring order flag may not be visible
   in other tabs even after reload and the shopper and may need to restart checkout flow.

1. Support for Organization, Users and Approvals administrative tools for buyer administrators or buyer approvers within the store will launch the
   corresponding UI from Management Center from with the store UI as described here: https://help.hcltechsw.com/commerce/9.1.0/storeseparation/refs/react_b2bbuyers.html.  
   A user can access these administrative tools within the store with the same session when logging in from the store's login page.
   If the same user logs in to Management Center from another browser tab or window, this action will terminate the same user's session in the store.
   Returning to the browser window in the store UI will require relogging in to the store. To avoid such issues, consider blocking access
   to Management Center host/port in production live environments for buyer adminstrators or buyer approvers.

1. The React store provides a react component for content-recommendations that can display marketing content business objects created in Management Center.
   The React store application provides an implementation that renders sample content ads as shown in Emerald and Sapphire stores, but can utilize only a subset
   of the fields available in the marketing content tool. The source code is provided and can be customized to render in the storefront while making use of
   additional fields. Some Marketing content fields that are NOT currently used by the react component in the application include:

- Any Marketing content type with 'click action type' = 'Predefined click action'
- Any Marketing content type with 'click action type' = 'Predefined click action for promotion'
- Marketing content type 'Asset' with 'Number of click action' = 'Multiple (Image Map)'
