LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Customer and HCL.

Program Name: HCL Commerce Enterprise Developer Version 9.1.4

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

As described in the HCL Master License Agreement (the “MLA”) and this License Information, HCL grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program.  This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. HCL reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Specifications

Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program, alone or in combination with other services or products, in support of any of the following high risk activities: design, construction, control, or maintenance of nuclear facilities, mass transit systems, air traffic control systems, automotive control systems, weapons systems, or aircraft navigation or communications, or any other activity where program failure could give rise to a material threat of death or serious personal injury.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

The following terms are defined for the purposes of this license:

Store - A storefront deployed in HCL Commerce that is accessible to customers for online business through any channel and/or touchpoint including, but limited not to, web, mobile devices, call centers, kiosks, and in-store solutions. A Store can be identified and counted by a unique STORE_ID key in the STORE table in HCL Commerce database, and by a value of B2C in the STORETYPE column of the STORE table.

Production - Use of a HCL Commerce server program to operate one or more live Stores

Staging - Use of a HCL Commerce server program in which Store information and business content like catalog and promotions are managed in a separate environment from a Production server, and where incremental changes/updates are made, tested with fully developed application in preparation for promotion to the Production utilizing staging server utilities including but not limited to stagingprop, stagingcopy, and fileprop. Staging is meant for final review and end user sign off on the fully developed solution prior to promoting to Production.

Test - Use of a HCL Commerce server program for testing of a HCL Commerce solution, including but not limited to functional, integration, system, performance, and load testing. Testing does not include Staging, provided that Testing may include testing of Staging server utilities and functions.

2.0 Authorized Use

Licensee may use the Program for development and Testing purposes only, and may not use the Program for Production or Staging purposes.

Licensee may only use HCL Commerce Developer Enterprise to develop or Test HCL Commerce assets (such as Stores, Store features or services) for Production use on HCL Commerce Enterprise and not for other HCL Commerce editions.

2.1 ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR SAMPLE MATERIALS

Sample Material included with the Program include Starter Stores.

Licensee is authorized to install each component of these copies of the WebSphere Application Server on the same machine as the remainder of the Program for use by a single developer for purposes of "unit testing", which is limited to testing of code written or generated by such developer to confirm that such code functions as designed. Licensee is not authorized to use copies of the WebSphere Application Server components installed and used under Unit Test Proofs of Entitlement for the following purposes: testing applications on servers separate from the developer's machine; or simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, application or system. The WebSphere Application Server components cannot be used for production purposes.

3.2 IBM DB2
- Entitlement: No Metric
- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration

Additional Supporting Program Details

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.
